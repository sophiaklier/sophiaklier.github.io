  <p>
    i am a 19 year old girl living in berlin.
i love plants, decorating my flat and sunshine (and snow in the winter). at the moment i’m studying graphic design at the htw berlin as a freshman. <br>
to be honest there’s no tangible reason for you to work with me yet since i actually don’t have any practical experience at all. <br>
but i can tell you: i love every part of my course of studies, i am more than motivated and thrilled. so stop by in a couple of months again and get overwhelmed by all the stuff i’ve made until then! <br>
you will get to to see web- and printdesign, photographs and other things i enjoy.
